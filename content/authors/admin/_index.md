Maryia Bakhtsiyarava is a Postdoctoral Scholar at Department of the City and Regional Planning and the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California Berkeley. At Berkeley, she is part of the international, multi-university Salud Urbana en América Latina (SALURBAL), Urban Health in Latin America collaboration that investigates the social and environmental determinants of health in urban areas in Latin America. Maryia's research focuses on understanding the relationships between climate and weather related environmental exposures such as heat waves, extreme tempearatures, and rainfall and health outcomes including mortality and birth outcomes, and the role of greenspace in these relationships. Maryia's most recent research quantifies the burden of temperature-related mortality under different global warming scenarios in Latin American cities. Her research combines demographic data from individual-level live birth records, vital statistics offices, censuses and surveys with environmental data from gridded datasets and satellite imagery.
